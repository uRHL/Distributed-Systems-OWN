Add debugging symbols: 
    p var /* Print var (also strings, but not other kind of vectors) */
    b file_name:line_num /* breakpoint */
    r <args> /* start the execution with args required by myapp*/
    l /* list */
    n /* next instruction */
    c /* continue the execution */
    bt /* backtrace, to know where you are, what caused the call */
    t /* go to a specific thread. Useful for multithread applications */

1) add compilation flag -g
2) gdb -args <arg1 arg2 ...> ./myapp
3) Type Enter to execute the last command again
